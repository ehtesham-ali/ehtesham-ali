- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ehtesham-ali. I am a high school student deeply interested in programming!

I'm building short and sweet Python projects right now, but I'm slowly building up skills
that'll eventually lead to bigger and more interesting projects that will involve RPi's! This is just the beginning of a long adventure, and this is a place for me to document my journey!
